            <p>During the 1930s, the Great Depression brought about a period of turmoil and panic in America. While America was recovering, Oklahoma native Will Rogers moved to Beverly Hills and brought life back to the once-bustling city of Los Angeles. With his southern cowboy charm, Will Rogers changed the lives of audiences throughout various mediums, including television, newspapers and books, radio broadcasts, and more.</p>
         <p>Rogers was born in Cherokee Indian Territory in Oklahoma, and his father held a prominent leadership role in Cherokee society. He always wanted his son to be business-oriented and responsible; however, Rogers’ easygoing, boyish spirit often led him to trouble.  After tenth grade, Rogers dropped out of school to become a cowboy, directing his focus towards horses and roping.  He later left home in 1901 to become a gaucho in Argentina.  After losing all of his money, Rogers left for South Africa to join Texas Jack’s Wild West Circus.  He quit Texas Jack’s to take part in a new circus in Australia before eventually heading back to the United States to become a vaudeville performer. Though Rogers frequently traveled from city to city, he never abandoned his ranch-life roots.</p>
