            <p>During the 1930s, the Great Depression brought about a period of turmoil and panic in America. While America was recovering, Oklahoma native Will Rogers moved to Beverly Hills and brought life back to the once-bustling city of Los Angeles. With his southern cowboy charm, Will Rogers changed the lives of audiences throughout various mediums, including television, newspapers and books, radio broadcasts, and more.</p>
         
         <p>Rogers was born in Cherokee Indian Territory in Oklahoma, and his father held a prominent leadership role in Cherokee society. He always wanted his son to be business-oriented and responsible; however, Rogers’ easygoing, boyish spirit often led him to trouble.  After tenth grade, Rogers dropped out of school to become a cowboy, directing his focus towards horses and roping.  He later left home in 1901 to become a gaucho in Argentina.  After losing all of his money, Rogers left for South Africa to join Texas Jack’s Wild West Circus.  He quit Texas Jack’s to take part in a new circus in Australia before eventually heading back to the United States to become a vaudeville performer. Though Rogers frequently traveled from city to city, he never abandoned his ranch-life roots.</p>
         
         <p>Throughout Will Rogers’ life, the western cowboy transformed into a Hollywood star. Audiences fell in love with Rogers’ charisma because he offered humor and warmth at a time when all seemed hopeless. Rogers published a daily newspaper column in the Saturday Evening Post, in which he displayed his nostalgia for a happier, simpler past of an American farmer. Rogers produced his first twenty-two minute long silent film The Ropin’ Fool and appeared in many silent films; however, his audiences fell in love with him for his performances in “talkies.” This transition was very smooth for Rogers, and oddly, he never memorized his lines. Instead, he would read through the script and simply improvise, resulting in genuine performances. It was this sincerity that Hollywood and moviegoers fell in love with. Even movies released prior to his death, such as Steamboat ‘Round the Bend’, brought in great revenue. In Rogers’ radio broadcasts, he primarily focused on voicing his political opinion, often satirizing politicians and Congress. He befriended many politicians and strongly influenced the public’s opinion by building support for Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal Plan.</p>
